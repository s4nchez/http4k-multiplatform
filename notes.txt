* JDK 20 doesn't seem to be supported by Kotlin multiplatform?
* function interfaces (e.g. Filter, RoutingHttpHandler) are not supported by Kotlin multiplatform
* Should BodyMode be platform-specific? (i.e. by default, core doesn't care)
* Other things that need revisiting
    * UriTemplate (because of regex)
    * MimeTypes (where to load them initially)
    * Lens
    * Charset (used in Accept)
